Apart from being killer whale, orca is a design gallery of various web components like buttons, navbars etc. contributed by developers from everywhere. 

This is beginner repository for developers who are completely new to open source and are often intimidated by huge codebases because its something I personally felt back when I started coding initially. This will guide you how to study codebases, ways to contribute, ask questions, create proper pull requests and issues, and most importantly, let you have a taste of open source development.

## Running the project ⛏️

Once you've cloned the project on your local system, you can run the server locally 

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the server and open the tab in new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Contributing

The code editors are ready, the server is running and now it's time for coding. Head on to the Contributing Wiki for an in depth guide as to how we will proceed with our open source journey!

If you are somewhat familiar and just need a quick overview, dive right in the [Contributing Quickguide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to start creating pull requests
